Tic Tac Toe mini game completely made using Angular. 
This was to get me into the personal project mindset. This was the first one done completely by myself, I used no ressources only what I learned in school. 
Commands:
npm ci
npm start

this is not the final version. The code is a bit redundant and can probably be simplified. 

Improvements:
-Swap Feature, allows player1 to use the circles. Right now player1 can only use X.
-Functional rule button that explains the rules of tictactoe.
-A nicer and clearer way of announcing the winner. 
-Possibly a log of the outcomes of the game on the right side of the board, as there is empty room on the page. 
-Simpler code, as there is many instances of redundant code presently. 
-Better Asthetics.
